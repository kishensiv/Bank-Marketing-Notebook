# Bank-Marketing-Notebook
Given a dataset from a Portuguese Banking Institution on their clients, predicted whether clients were likely to subscribe to a term deposit. Conducted preprocessing, 
Exploratory Data Analysis and PCA to reduce dimensionality and account for multicolleniarity, before building building Logistic Regresion and Random Forest Models, both 
with elastic-net regularization and hyperparameter optimization for prediction. Addionally, as a side venture, built a Linear Regression Model to predict the clients current balance
with the banking institution.
